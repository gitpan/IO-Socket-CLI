IO::Socket::SSL. It's already extended with IO::Socket::CLI::IMAP,
IO::Socket::CLI::IMAPS, IO::Socket::CLI::SMTP, IO::Socket::CLI::SMTPS,
IO::Socket::CLI::POP3, and IO::Socket::CLI::POP3S. Default settings are for

are compliant before trying to address bugs in an email client, or whatever
other client you're developing.
